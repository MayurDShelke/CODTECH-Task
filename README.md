Task 2 
Library Management System

The Library Management System is designed to help manage library resources like books, magazines, and DVDs. Users can perform tasks such as adding items, searching for items by title, checking out and returning items, and viewing all available items in the library.

Features:
1. Add Items: Users can add books, magazines, and DVDs to the library.
2. Search Items: Items can be searched by title.
3. Check Out Items: Users can check out items if they are available.
4. Return Items: Users can return checked-out items.
5. Display All Items: Displays a list of all library items with their availability.

How It Works:
- Persistence: The system saves the library data to a file (`library.dat`), so the data is retained between program runs.
  - Classes: 
  - LibraryItem: Represents an item in the library.
  - Library: Manages items and handles the core functionality (add, search, check-out, etc.).
  - LibrarySystem: Provides a user interface for interacting with the system.

Advantages:
-Data is saved and loaded** to maintain library state.
-Simple interface** for easy use.

This system helps efficiently manage library resources with an easy-to-use interface and file-based storage.
